## Docker:
1. This app's using external volume for DB so before you start you should create this volume:
    #### docker volume create --name=pg_volume
2. After that build and launch containers:
    #### docker-compose up -d --build
For now app is available at localhost


If you'll need any *manage.py* commands then you'll want to use prefix:

    docker-compose exec backend python manage.py *comand*
